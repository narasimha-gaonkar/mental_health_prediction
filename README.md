# Overview:
To find the frequency and prediction of mental illness of employees in the tech industry based on various factors like gender, geographical location, history of mental health illness by using several Data Visualization methods, Data Normalization and Machine Learning models.

Project Structure:

**Data Normalization**: The dataset is transformed into a normalized format and stored in an SQLite database to enhance data organization and efficiency.

**Data Visualization**: Visualizations are generated using libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly to display key statistics and trends related to mental health in the IT industry.

**Machine Learning Models**: Various machine learning algorithms are implemented using libraries like Scikit-Learn to make predictions about mental health outcomes.
